## Description

For our third module challenge we were asked to create a randomized password generator that would take selected user prompts and organize them into a user specific password. We were asked to include symbols, numbers, lower and uppercase letters depending on the user's choosing. This helped us display a knowledge of for loops, if statements, functions, object methods, arrays, variables, and listener events to give a good look into our beginner toolkit for javaScript.


## Installation

n/a

## Usage

As a user when I click on the button to generate my password the writePassword function is ran which then runs my generatePassword funtion that meets me with a prompt asking me to pick a password length. If I choose a number below 8 or above 128 I am met with another prompt to ask me to meet a number within that range. Following this I am met with a series of confirms for whether I would like to include special characters, numbers, lowercase, and/or uppercase letters. My code then runs a for loop that pulls random characters from each specified string into a character pool which is then pushed into a finalPassword array and returned. See below for a screenshot demonstrating my code in the console.
